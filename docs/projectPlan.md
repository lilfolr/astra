Project Plan: Starship Home (v1.0)

Phase 1: Foundation & Ship Specs (Weeks 1-2)

Goal: Finalize the game logic and technical environment.

Database Schema: Design the JSON tree for Starship IDs, Crew Roles, and Module status.

Narrative Design: Write the "Ship AI" dialogue library (Red Alerts, Success messages, Onboarding).

Legal/Safety: Draft basic terms of service regarding data privacy (especially for minors).

Tech Spike: Set up Flutter + Firebase environment and test real-time state syncing across two devices.

Phase 2: Core Systems Development (Weeks 3-6)

Goal: Build the functional "Chore Engine."

Module Mapping: Create the UI for parents to "scan" their home and map rooms to Ship Modules.

Task Logic: Build the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system for "Missions."

The Shared Health Bar: Implement the "Hull Integrity" calculation logic (Total Tasks Completed / Total Tasks Assigned).

Auth & Family Linking: Develop the "Captain's Invite" system to link Crew members via QR code.

Phase 3: The "Game" Layer (Weeks 7-10)

Goal: Add the "Juice" that makes it feel like a spaceship.

The Command Deck: Build the interactive 2D ship map using the Flame engine.

Credit/XP System: Implement the "Hangar" (Reward Shop) and currency tracking.

Visual FX: Add haptic feedback, neon UI animations, and "Red Alert" screen overlays.

AI Integration: Set up automated notifications for "Hull Breaches" (overdue tasks).

Phase 4: Beta Testing (Weeks 11-12)

Goal: Polish based on real family feedback.

Closed Beta: Invite 10-20 "Alpha Families" to use the app for 14 days.

Feedback Loop: Focus on "Friction Points"—is the game becoming a chore itself?

Bug Squashing: Fix sync issues and notification lag.

Phase 5: Launch & Expansion (Week 13+)

Goal: Go live and start the revenue engine.

App Store Launch: Deploy to iOS and Android.

Monetization V1: Integrate Stripe for "Pro" subscriptions.

Partnerships: Reach out to house-cleaning or maintenance services for the "Repair Droid" affiliate program.

Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope

To launch by Week 13, the MVP will include:

Shared Hull Integrity Bar (The "All for one" motivator).

Basic Room Mapping (Max 5 modules).

Real-time Task Completion (Instant XP gain).
